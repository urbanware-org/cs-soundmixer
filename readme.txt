    Quite a long time ago, a good friend of mine came up with the idea to
    locally replace the original Counter-Strike sounds with user-defined ones
    from other games just for fun, mostly old MS-DOS games and two developers
    named Team Acidous created this project.

    The SoundMixer was made and primarily used for Counter-Strike 1.6, but
    later also for Counter-Strike: Source. I have not tested whether it is
    compatible with later or any other versions of the game and also do not
    have any information about that.

    Originally, the project was developed using Visual Studio Express 2012,
    but was also buildable with Visual Studio Community 2015 and should still
    be with later versions.

    Please do not ask me anything about the code, as I cannot provide much
    information and have not reviewed it at all.

    This repository is archived and will remain in the state it is now, so
    there will be no enhancements, improvements or whatsoever as the code has
    not been touched for many years and, as already mentioned, the original
    authors do not maintain it anymore.

    The reason why I uploaded the project here is that it might be more or
    less useful for other people.

    All text files within the sub-directory are from the original authors and
    have been directly translated. So, I cannot confirm the accuracy of their
    content, but I assume it is correct as they were part of the last version.
    However, there is no guarantee for that.

    See the 'Howto.txt' file for details how the SoundMixer must be installed
    and configured.

    Feel free to fork.
